After running a lot of low-level PUG Mythic+ dungeons since I started playing WoW in Dragonflight Season 4, I realised something: even with all the amazing video content out there, many players still struggle with the key mechanics for their role.

This addon is designed to help developing players by surfacing the most important information for each boss — right when they need it.

It’s not a replacement for learning the dungeons, and I highly recommend checking out the fantastic video guides listed below to get fully up to speed. But if this helps remind players of what to watch for in the heat of the moment, I’ll consider it a win.

DungeonGuide is a smart, role-aware Mythic+ companion designed to give you just the right information at the right time.

### 🧭 Features
- 📍 Auto-detects your dungeon and encounter
- 🛡 **Role-based content:** Separate notes for Tank, Healer, DPS, and ALL
- 🧠 **Tactical reminders:** Calls, interrupts, mechanics, positioning
- 🎯 **Compact and concise:** Just the essentials — no clutter
- 🧩 **Manual override:** Open any guide manually with /dg or dropdown
- 🎛 **Fully configurable UI:** Fonts, row spacing, colours by type
- 🖱 Movable and resizable panel — persists between sessions
- ❗ Guide content is hand-written and frequently updated.
- 📢 More features  coming soon!
- ✅ Works perfectly with ElvUI.

### 💡 Designed for
- Tanks who want to lead with confidence
- Healers who prep cooldowns like a pro
- DPS who care about mechanics
- Groups learning routes and key moments

### 🕹 How it works
- When you enter a dungeon, the Guide button appears.
- You can **right-click** the button to move it. Right-click again to stop movement.
- Click the button to open the Guide panel with strategy tips for your role and boss.
- The guide panel can be moved and resized.
- The small section selection button (top left of Guide panel) allows a specific section of the guide to be shown.
- **Call** guide entries, light blue stripe, will be party said if clicked.
- Font size, row height and guide type colours can be changed in the Options -> Addons -> DungeonGuide.

### 🛠️ Slash Command
- You can use the `/dg` command to test content.
- `/dg [ROLE] @ [ENCOUNTER] @ [DUNGEON]`

*Examples*
- `/dg TANK @ Head Machinist Sparkflux @ Operation: Mechagon`
- `/dg DPS @ Baron Braunpyke @ Priory of the Sacred Flame`


### 🧾 In-Game Editor

Starting in v1.3, DungeonGuide includes a full in-game Editor — designed to give you complete control over your guide content without ever leaving WoW.

Whether you want to tweak the text of a mechanic callout, change a role tag, hide an outdated note, or just reorder entries — you can now do it all from within the game.

It’s fast, intuitive, and built to support real Mythic+ gameplay.

### 🧠 What it’s for
- Fixing or adjusting guides to suit your group’s strategy
- Hiding entries you don’t care about
- Editing text for clarity or personal reminders
- Reordering mechanics to match your preferred flow
- Adding **new guide entries** from scratch

### 🛠️ How to access it
- Open any guide using the usual Guide button
- Click the ☰ hamburger menu in the top-right
- Choose Editor from the dropdown

### 📋 Editor features
- 📝 Edit the text, type, role, and visibility of each entry
- 🔢 Reorder entries by editing the ORDER field
- 🎨 Edited rows are highlighted in blue and saved on Save
- 🧼 Reset an encounter to revert all changes
- 🎯 Only changed entries are saved — if you undo a change, it’s auto-cleaned

### ✏️ Editing Encounter Guides
Once inside:
- Use the left pane to select a dungeon and then an encounter.
- The main panel will display all guide entries for that encounter.

Each row includes:
- **ORDER** - Change the order of entries by typing a new number.
- **TYPE** - Set to Call, Interrupt, Position, or Mechanic.
- **ROLE** - Choose the role this entry applies to: ALL, TANK, HEALER, or DPS.
- **GUIDE** - Edit the guide text shown in the dungeon.
- **HIDE** - Check to temporarily disable this entry.

### 📌 Notes

- You can use the Reset button to return any encounter to its default guide

### 🚧 Coming soon
- 📤 Export and 📥 Import your guide edits

### 🪄 Jump Feature (New in v1.3.2)
Jump entries are a powerful way to streamline your in-dungeon navigation experience. These special guide lines act like smart bookmarks — clicking one will immediately switch the Guide panel to a different section of the same dungeon.

### 📌 What it’s for
- Quickly navigating between trash pulls and boss fights
- Creating clear breakpoints between major segments
- Linking back to key fights for reuse or emphasis

### 🛠 How it works
- Jump entries appear in your guide like any other line, with their own row and type: Jump
- Clicking a Jump will immediately load the target guide section
- You can add or edit Jump entries in the in-game Editor just like any other guide row

### 🧭 Tips for using Jump
- Use Jump entries at the end of intro sections to link straight into the first boss
- Add a Jump after key trash packs to send players to the next boss
- For longer routes, chain Jumps to help your group stay on track

### 🧰 In the Editor
When editing a Jump entry, a new TARGET field appears. This must exactly match the name of the section you want to jump to (e.g., "Captain Dailcry"). If the target doesn’t exist or is typed incorrectly, the jump will silently fail.

### 📎 Jump lines are fully customisable
- Set their ROLE (ALL, TANK, HEALER, DPS)
- Use clear, concise text (e.g., “Boss Fight: Captain Dailcry”)
- Reorder them anywhere within the guide

🧼 Like all other guide entries, Jumps can be edited, hidden, reordered, or deleted — and they persist across sessions.
