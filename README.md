# DungeonGuide Addon for World of Warcraft

**DungeonGuide** is a lightweight and powerful addon for World of Warcraft (Retail, post-Dragonflight) that provides encounter-specific guidance inside dungeons. It is designed to support all roles with concise, practical tips for bosses, trash, and route planning — all visible directly in-game.

Whether you're tanking a Mythic+ run, healing in Heroics, or just exploring new dungeons, DungeonGuide helps you and your group stay informed and coordinated.
